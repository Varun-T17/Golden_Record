# Golden_Record

This is a program that identifies matches of a record within a datset using Tf-Idf and then narrows it down using further matching techniques.

I have attached the program files, the Backup Dataset which I use to check matches, the dataset I tested the program on (Note: I removed some fields from some rows to test whether my dataset can detect matches even when fields are missing), the matches, and the groupings created by the program.

Note: All data is fake, and doesn't represent or try to represent anyone in real life.
